I have hade the amazing opportunity to be part of the AP Capstone Program and Honors Institute at Bishop Alemany. These opportunities have allowed me to excel in this learning environment by teaching my how to efficienty make use of all resources available to me. As a senior, students in the program are enrolled in AP Research and we are encouraged to conduct research that will serve to be benficial to the global scholarly community. As this course gives me the freedom to conduct research about my interests, I was able to conduct research regarding students learning algebra because I enjoy learning and teaching mathematics. Additioanlly, I was able to learn how to code together my own website on my own, in hopes of conducting research that will prove to be beneficial and to provide a free tutoring program for students in the community.</div>
